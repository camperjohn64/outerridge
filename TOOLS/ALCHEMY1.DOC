          Introduction to Image Alchemy
          -------------------------------------------------------------------


          What is Image    Image Alchemy is a software utility that
          Alchemy?         manipulates computer image files.


                           Primarily, Image Alchemy converts between various
                           graphics file formats.  Image Alchemy can
                           translate between a large variety of file formats
                           including industry standards such as GIF and TIFF
                           as well as vendor specific file formats such as
                           Sun Raster and Scodl.  Currently Alchemy supports
                           over 60 different formats, and new formats are
                           always being added; in fact, our goal is to have
                           Image Alchemy be able to read and write every
                           graphics file in the world.


                           Image Alchemy can also make changes in an image.
                           For example, Image Alchemy can re-size an image,
                           change the number of colours in an image, change
                           an image from colour to black and white, and
                           change the colour space an image uses.


                           Finally, Image Alchemy performs JPEG compression.
                           This is a standard for image compression that can
                           achieve much higher compression ratios than
                           conventional compression techniques.  It achieves
                           this high compression ratio by not entirely
                           preserving the original image (this is referred to
                           as "lossy" compression).  For further information
                           see Appendix C, "What is JPEG Compression".

          2          Image Alchemy





          Pathnames        Because the MS-DOS and UNIX operating systems use
                           different conventions for path names, users of
                           UNIX will have to substitute forward slashes, "/",
                           for the back slashes, "\", found in the examples
                           in this manual.




          Unintentional    UNIX users should also be aware that the UNIX
          wildcard         shell they are using may be performing wildcard
          expansion        expansion on certain characters (generally "*" and
                           "?").  Since these are options which Alchemy uses,
                           they need to be escaped to prevent the wildcard
                           substitution.  This is done by using a back slash,
                           "\", before the character (so -? becomes -\?).

          Installing Image Alchemy
          -------------------------------------------------------------------


          Overview         Installation of Image Alchemy is simple; it
                           involves copying the Alchemy program off of the
                           floppy disk or tape onto your hard drive or
                           network.


                           You need to be familiar with the copy command if
                           doing a DOS installation and the tar command if
                           doing a UNIX installation.  If you are not
                           familiar with these commands you may wish to read
                           the manuals which came with your computer or ask
                           someone to assist you.


                           The installation instructions are divided into
                           different sections for Image Alchemy for MS-DOS,
                           Image Alchemy/386, and Image Alchemy for UNIX.
                           Please refer to the section which corresponds to
                           your hardware.



























          4          Image Alchemy




          Image Alchemy for MS-DOS
          -------------------------------------------------------------------


          Required         At a minimum you must have the following hardware
          equipment        and software to run Image Alchemy.




                 Computer  An MS-DOS computer equipped with an 80286, 80386,
                           or 80486.


                           Many of the conversions that Alchemy does are cpu
                           intensive, so a faster computer is definitely an
                           advantage.




                   Memory  At least 400k of free memory.


                           Some conversions and some images require even more
                           memory (Alchemy will attempt to use all available
                           system memory, so if you get out-of-memory errors
                           or warnings try removing as many resident programs
                           as you can (also, installing MS-DOS 5.0, MS-DOS
                           6.0, or a 3rd party memory manager such as 386MAX
                           or QEMM will free up more memory)).


                           Alchemy makes use of extended, expanded, and xms
                           memory while performing conversions.  This can
                           greatly speed up the conversion process.  In
                           general you will need as much memory as the size
                           of the image, in pixels, being converted.  For
                           example, a 640x480 true colour image will use 900k
                           of memory).

               Hard drive  A hard drive with at least as much free space as
                           four times the size of the image being converted
                           (i.e. a 640x480 image will require approximately
                           1.2 megabytes of free space).




                  Display  A supported VGA, 8514/A, or XGA board, if you wish
                           to view images.



                                                     Image Alchemy          5





                           Supported SVGA boards include those with a VESA
                           driver or with the Paradise, Everex, Trident,
                           Video 7, ATI, Ahead, NCR, or Tseng Labs chipsets.


                           Supported 8514/A boards include IBM and those with
                           the Western Digital chipset.



                Operating  MS-DOS or PC-DOS 3.x or greater (because of the
                   system  additional free memory available use of MS-DOS 5.0
                           or MS-DOS 6.0 is highly recommended).




          Optional         The following hardware and software is optional to
          equipment        run Image Alchemy.




           VESA VGA board  To get full use out of viewing images on a SVGA
                           board a VESA driver is needed.  Without a VESA
                           driver Alchemy is limited to displaying images in
                           320x200x256, 360x480x256, and 640x400x256 modes
                           (and 640x480x32768 if you SVGA board is capable of
                           15 bit operation);  with a VESA driver the
                           resolution is limited only by your SVGA board and
                           monitor.  Resolutions up to 1280x1024x256 and
                           1280x1024x16 million are possible.



                           The VESA driver is supplied by the manufacturer of
                           your SVGA board.  It may already be included in
                           the BIOS on your SVGA board, or it may have been
                           shipped on a floppy disk with your SVGA board.
                           Consult the documentation that came with the SVGA
                           board.  If there is no mention of a VESA driver in
                           the documentation contact your dealer or the
                           manufacturer of your SVGA board; VESA drivers are
                           currently available for VGA boards using chipsets
                           from Cirrus Logic, ATI Technologies, Chips and
                           Technologies, Everex Systems, Genoa Systems,
                           Paradise Logic, Sigma Designs, STB Systems,

          Installation     1. Insert the appropriate floppy disk in your disk
          instructions        drive.

                           2. Change to the drive by typing either a: or b:.

                           3. Type install.  This will install Image Alchemy
                              in the c:\alchemy directory.

                              If you would like to install on a different
                              drive or a specific directory, you can do this
                              by typing install followed by the location
                              where you want Image Alchemy installed.

                              For example:  install d:\util\alchemy will
                              install the software in the d:\util\alchemy
                              directory.

                           5. You have now successfully installed Image
                              Alchemy.

                           6. The file read.me contains information which has
                              changed since the manual was printed.  To
                              display the read.me file type type read.me.


          Environment
          variable usage


           Temporary disk  Alchemy uses the environment variable TMP to
                    files  determine where to open its temporary files.  If
                           you have a big enough ram drive you will want to
                           specify it using the TMP variable.  Be aware that
                           Alchemy needs up to 4 times as much space on that
                           drive as the size of the image (a 640 by 480 image
                           requires up to 1.2 Megabytes).  An example of
                           setting the TMP variable to drive e: would be "set
                           TMP=e:".
















          8          Image Alchemy




          Use of extended  If there is enough extended or expanded memory
             and expanded  available, Alchemy will use it instead of the
                   memory  temporary file it would otherwise use during some
                           conversions.  To use extended memory you must have
                           an XMS driver installed in the config.sys file
                           (such as HIMEM.SYS or 386MAX). To use expanded
                           memory you must have a LIM 3.2 or LIM 4.0 expanded
                           memory driver installed (such as EMM386, QEMM, or
                           386MAX).

                           Alchemy's use of extended/expanded memory can be
                           disabled.  To disable the use of extended and
                           expanded memory, set an environment variable
                           called 'alchemy' to 'x' (type "set alchemy=x" at
                           the DOS prompt).

                           Note that the availability of extended or expanded
                           memory will not allow you to convert larger
                           images, it will just increase the speed of
                           conversions.  If you need to convert very large
                           images we also have a 386 Enhanced version of
                           Image Alchemy, which will allow 80386 and 80486
                           users to make use of the linear addressing space
                           of those processors along with virtual memory to
                           convert images of up to 32000 x 32000 (assuming
                           you have enough disk space).  Please contact us if
                           you are running out of memory and are interested
                           in upgrading to Image Alchemy/386.

             Checking for  Alchemy will normally check to determine if there
            8514/A boards  is an 8514/A board installed in the computer when
                           viewing images.  However, this can cause problems
                           with some network boards, as they use the same I/O
                           addresses that 8514/A boards use.  To disable
                           8514/A checking, set the environment variable
                           called 'alchemy' to '8' (type "set alchemy=8" at
                           the DOS prompt).


                           Note that this can be combined with other options;
                           for example, to disable both 8514/A checking and
                           extended/expanded memory usage, use
                           "set alchemy=8x".











                                                     Image Alchemy          9




                 Limiting  Alchemy will automatically choose the lowest
          maximum display  resolution which will fit the entire image when
               resolution  viewing images without specifying a display
                           resolution with a VESA compatible VGA board.
                           However, depending on the monitor and VGA board
                           combination you have, this can be bad since the
                           monitor may not support the particular resolution
                           the SVGA board is trying to switch to.  To avoid
                           this problem, the environment variable 'alchemy'
                           may now be set to indicate the maximum display
                           resolution which Alchemy should use.  Set the
                           alchemy variable to the highest horizontal
                           resolution which your monitor is capable of.
                           Valid values are 1280, 1024, 800, and 640.  For
                           example, type "set alchemy=800" at the DOS prompt
                           if your monitor only supports 640x480 and 800x600
                           mode.

                           Note that this can be combined with other options;
                           for example, to disable 8514/A checking, disable
                           extended/expanded memory usage, and limit the
                           viewing resolution to 640x480 use
                           "set alchemy=8x640".  You can also place this line
                           in your autoexec.bat file.

          Image Alchemy/386 for MS-DOS
          -------------------------------------------------------------------


          Required         At a minimum you must have the following hardware
          equipment        and software to run Image Alchemy/386.



                 Computer  An MS-DOS computer equipped with an 80386, 80486,
                           or other 32bit Intel processor.

                           Many of the conversions that Alchemy does are cpu
                           intensive, so a faster computer is definitely an
                           advantage.



                   Memory  At least 2MB of free memory.



               Hard drive  A hard drive with at least as much free space as
                           four times the size of the image being converted
                           (i.e. a 640x480 image will require approximately
                           1.2 megabytes of free space).



           Viewing Images  Alchemy/386 does not support viewing at this time.



                Operating  MS-DOS or PC-DOS 3.x or greater (because of the
                   system  additional free memory available, use of MS-DOS
                           5.0 or MS-DOS 6.0 is highly recommended).





                     Math  A math coprocessor will not affect the speed of
              coprocessor  most operations; the only operations that use much
                           floating point math are scaling types c and d.

                                        Alchemy.

                           ALCHEMY.EXE  The real-mode Alchemy software.

                           READ.ME      A text document describing any last
                                        minute revisions.

                           SAMPLES      A directory containing sample data
                                        files and images.  See the READ.ME
                                        file in this directory for further
                                        information.


          Installation     1. Insert the appropriate floppy disk in your disk
          instructions        drive.

                           2. Change to the drive by typing either a: or b:.

                           3. Type install.  This will install Image Alchemy
                              in the c:\alchemy directory.

                              If you would like to install on a different
                              drive or a specific directory, you can do this
                              by typing install followed by the location
                              where you want Image Alchemy installed.

                              For example:  install d:\util\alchemy will
                              install the software in the d:\util\alchemy
                              directory.

                           4. You have now successfully installed Image
                              Alchemy.

                           5. The file read.me contains information which has
                              changed since the manual was printed.  To

           Temporary disk  Alchemy uses the environment variable TMP to
                    files  determine where to open its temporary files.  If
                           you have a big enough RAM drive you will want to
                           specify it using the TMP variable.  Be aware that
                           Alchemy needs up to 4 times as much space on that
                           drive as the size of the image (a 640x480 image
                           requires up to 1.2 megabytes).  An example of
                           setting the TMP variable to drive e: would be "set
                           TMP=e:".

                                        information.



          Installation     Use tar to copy the files from the distribution
          instructions     disk or tape to the current directory.


                           To install the software from diskette use:

                                tar xvf /dev/fd0


                           For tape installation replace /dev/fd0 with the
                           name of the tape device.  The name of the tape
                           device varies between different models and
                           configurations of systems; ask your system
                           administrator if you don't know the name of your
                           tape device.


          Note to          Alchemy uses the environment variable TMPDIR to
          advanced users   determine where to put its temporary files.  This
                           is usually set to /usr/tmp or /tmp, but if you are
                           converting very large images there may not be
                           enough space available in the partition those
                           directories are on.  In that case you may want to
                           set the environment variable TMPDIR to a different
                           partition.  For example, to set the temporary file
                           directory to the directory /home/images use
                           "setenv TMPDIR /home/images".  Contact your system
                           administrator if you have problems with Alchemy
                           running out of disk space while converting images.

          Introduction
          -------------------------------------------------------------------


          Basic            Image Alchemy is a command-line driven program
          instructions     with an optional menu system.  Historically, Image
                           Alchemy has been exclusively command-line driven,
                           and a lot of information in this manual is
                           necessary for users who prefer the command-line
                           interface.

                           For those users who prefer the menu interface, we
                           have tried to indicate which sections are relevant
                           to you and which you may safely skip.

                           Chapter 3 is devoted entirely to the menu
                           interface (also called a Graphical User Interface,
                           or GUI), and explains how to use the interface as
                           well as how Image Alchemy manages both interfaces.

                  Options  Options are the commands that you give Alchemy so
                           that it knows what you want it to do.  So that
                           Alchemy can distinguish between options and file
                           names on the command line, options are preceded by
                           a dash ("-").



                           The only option that is required is the output
                           file format (or the viewing option, for MS-DOS
                           users).  Image Alchemy will make reasonable
                           decisions for all of the other options.



                           Some options take parameters.  The parameters may
                           immediately follow the option or be separated by a
                           space.  For example, either -c128 or -c 128 is
                           acceptable.

                           Information on selecting options from the main
                           menu is covered in Chapter 3.



                           The options themselves are documented in Chapters
                           4 through 8.



          16          Image Alchemy






                           Note that options can appear anywhere in the
                           command line and generally they can be in any
                           order (certain options take parameters; in those
                           cases the parameters must follow the option).  The
                           case of the options is significant.


            InputFileName  The inputFileName is any valid file name.  This is
                           the name of an existing image file that you are
                           converting from or viewing.  The inputFileName is
                           required.  It may include an optional drive and/or
                           path.


           OutputFileName  The outputFileName is the name of the file you are
                           converting the image to.  The outputFileName is
                           optional;  if it is not specified Image Alchemy
                           generates one by substituting an appropriate
                           extension to the input file name.  If you specify
                           an outputFileName and it does not include an
                           extension one will be added.  The outputFileName
                           may include an optional drive and/or path.  If you
                           do not supply a path the current directory will be
                           used as the destination directory.


           OutputPathName  The outputPathName is the location where you want
                           to put the output that Alchemy will create.  The
                           outputPathName is optional;  if it is not
                           specified Alchemy places the output in the current
                           directory or in the directory specified as part of
                           the outputFileName.





          Limitations on   Since on the command line Alchemy lets you
          filenames        optionally enter a space between an option and its
                           parameter it is possible to confuse Alchemy if one
                           of the filenames starts with a number.  In
                           particular, if you use an option which has an
                           optional parameter, you choose not to use the
                           parameter, and you follow that option immediately
                           with a filename which starts with a number,
                           Alchemy doesn't realize that the filename is not
                           the parameter.  While it sounds unlikely that this
                           would ever be a problem it actually happens quite
                           often.

                           For example, if you wanted to convert the file
                           12.gif to a Targa file with the name output.tga
                           you would have to be careful of the order in which
                           you specified things.


                           If you say

                                alchemy -a 12.gif output.tga

                           Alchemy would misinterpret that as

                                alchemy -a12 .gif output.tga

                           and would generate an error.


                           The easiest way around this problem is to always
                           put the filenames first

                                alchemy 12.gif output.tga -a

                           or don't use filenames which begin with a number.

          Output path      The output path name is the location where Alchemy
                           will place its output.

                           The outputPathName can be specified on the command
                           line as part of the outputFileName if you are
                           specifying an outputFileName.

                           For example

                                alchemy sample.jpg -g test.gif \images

                           is the same as

                                alchemy sample.jpg -g \images\test.gif

                           However,

                                alchemy sample.jpg -g

                           is not the same as

                                alchemy sample.jpg -g \images

                           When using the wildcard option, Alchemy allows
                           wildcards and multiple file names.  In this case
                           the use of an outputFileName is not allowed, but
                           the use of the outputPathName is.  See the
                           wildcard option for more information.

          Using option     Alchemy can read command line parameters from
          files            files.  Doing this is equivalent to typing the
                           options on the command line.  Lists of options are
                           useful when you have commonly used commands or
                           when you have long commands which would be hard to
                           remember or exceed the command line limits of your
                           operating system.

                           To use an option file you will have to create a
                           text file using a text editor.  This file can have
                           any name or extension you wish.  To pass this file
                           to Alchemy use the @ operator, followed
                           immediately by the name of the text file.

                           For example, if you frequently need to scale
                           images to be no larger than 640x480, using 'b'
                           quality scaling, and preserving aspect ratio, you
                           can make a text file which looks like this (called
                           SCALE, for purposes of this example):

                                -Xb640 -Yb480 -+


                           You would then use this text file with Alchemy by
                           passing its name along with any other options
                           (including the output file type option).  For
                           example:

                                alchemy @scale test.gif -g new.gif

                           would convert the GIF file test.gif to a GIF file
                           called new.gif, thus performing the desired
                           scaling operation.

                           It is also possible to place filenames and other
                           option lists in options lists.  For example, if
                           you want to convert  all of the .gif, .tif, and
                           .tga files to JPEG files you can create a text
                           file which looks like this (called FILES):

                                *.gif
                                *.tif
                                *.tga

                           And then use this command line to convert those
                           files to JPEG files:


                                                    Image Alchemy          19




                                alchemy @files -j

                           If you wanted to scale the images at the same time
                           you would add that option file to the command line
                           (using the SCALE text file created earlier):

                                alchemy @files @scale -j

          Using multiple   In general, Image Alchemy will perform equally
          runs of Alchemy  well regardless of how many steps it takes to
                           accomplish a command.  However, if you use
                           multiple steps, be careful of their order.

                           Sometimes you may know what you want to accomplish
                           but not how to specify the correct combination of
                           options.  For example, you may wish to re-size a
                           true colour Targa file that you have scanned and
                           convert it to a 16 colour GIF file.  Let's say
                           that the input file name is file.tga and you want
                           to generate a file with the name file.gif. In this
                           case you could type:

                                alchemy file.tga -Xb640 -Yb480 -c16 -g

                           However, there would be no penalty in quality (and
                           little in speed) if you did things in two steps:

                                alchemy file.tga -Xb640 -Yb480 -r temp.raw

                                alchemy temp.raw -c16 -g file.gif

                           In this case you are telling Alchemy to use a
                           temporary raw file called temp.raw.  It turns out
                           that Alchemy would have automatically used a
                           temporary raw file in the first case.  So, except
                           for having to delete the file temp.raw, both uses
                           are identical.

                           The order of steps is important in many cases.
                           For example, reversing the order of the two
                           operations in the previous example:

                                alchemy file.tga -c16 -g temp.raw

                                alchemy temp.raw -Xb640 -Yb480 -g file


                           would give different results.  This is because the
                           scaling operation has to temporarily convert the
                           image to true colour, but the GIF file you are
                           generating has to be paletted, so the second
                           operation would re-dither the image.


                           Sometimes you will have to perform operations
                           using multiple steps because there are some
                           combinations of options that Alchemy explicitly
                           does not allow.  These combinations of options are
                           not allowed because the results would not be what
                           you expect.


                                                    Image Alchemy          21





                           For example, using the spiff option, -S, in
                           combination with the false colour option, -F,
                           would spiff the image first and then false colour
                           it, which would give the same results as just
                           using the false colour option.  Since that isn't
                           something that you would ever want to do, Alchemy
                           will complain if you specify both of those options
                           at the same time.


                           In this case you could false colour the image
                           first, generating a temporary image, and then
                           spiff that image.

          The Graphical User Interface (Menus)
          -------------------------------------------------------------------


          Introduction     Image Alchemy v1.7 is the first release to
                           incorporate a Graphical User Interface (GUI),
                           commonly referred to as a menu system. The GUI can
                           make using Alchemy much easier for casual or
                           infrequent users, since the various command-line
                           arguments do not need to be memorized or even
                           known.

                           The GUI is actually a separate program which gets
                           information about the conversion from the user,
                           builds a command line for Alchemy, and then calls
                           the actual Alchemy software.  In this way, users
                           who are familiar with the command-line structure
                           of Alchemy will not be hampered by the menu system
                           -- the software can be used exactly as with
                           previous versions.  The GUI will also let you view
                           the command line parameters it uses, so that
                           interested users can learn more about Alchemy
                           itself and the switches it requires to perform
                           various conversions.

          Starting the     After installing Image Alchemy (described in
          GUI              Chapter 1), the Alchemy executable as well as the
                           GUI should be on your working drive.  The GUI will
                           be able to find the Alchemy executable as long as
                           it is in either the current directory or the DOS
                           search path.


                           Once your path has been set, simply typing 'gui'
                           will start Alchemy's graphical user interface.

          The Main Screen  Upon starting the GUI, the screen will be mostly
                           blank, except for a menu bar across the top of the
                           screen, and two small windows at the bottom
                           informing you of the currently selected input file
                           and the output file type.


                           To access the pull-down menu system, type Alt-?,
                           where ? is the first character of the option.  For
                           example, typing Alt-F will bring down the File
                           sub-menu, and Alt-D will bring down the Dither
                           sub-menu.

                           As you move through various options in the sub-
                           menus, a short help message will appear on the
                           bottom status line, giving you further
                           information.

                           While in the menu system, pressing Esc will abort
                           the current menu; if you are being prompted for a
                           value in a dialog box, Esc will abort the input,
                           and retain the old value.

                           Note that some sub-menu entries may be dimmed;
                           this means that these options cannot be used at
                           this time.  This usually applies to the viewing
                           and conversion options, which cannot be chosen
                           without first selecting an input file.

                           Pressing and releasing the Alt key will take you
                           up to the menu bar and pull down the first entry
                           (the File sub-menu, in this case).  The left and
                           right arrow keys will move between the various
                           sub-menus.  At this point, the up and down arrow
                           keys can be used to highlight a specific option;
                           pressing Return will select that option.


                           If you have a mouse connected to your system, you
                           can point-and-click through the menuing system,
                           rather than using the keyboard.  Clicking an entry
                           on the menu bar will pull down that menu, and then
                           clicking on a specific option will actually choose
                           it.  Alternatively, you can move the mouse cursor
                           to the menu bar, click on a sub-menu category like
                           File, and while continuing to hold down the mouse
                           button, select a specific item.  When you release
                           the mouse button, that item will be chosen.



          Quitting the     To exit the GUI, select Quit from the File sub-
          GUI              menu.  Alternatively, Alt-X will immediately quit
                           the GUI without going through the menu system.

             Select Input  Choosing this option will bring up a listing of
                    Image  all the files in the current directory.  Using
                           either the keyboard or the mouse, you can select
                           the input file on which Alchemy will work on.
                           There are also listings for the parent directory
                           and various subdirectories (if any), which allow
                           you to move around on the drive.


                           Clicking on the Cancel button or hitting Esc will
                           abort the selection process, keeping the previous
                           input file name.


                           Note that the GUI cannot check for valid image
                           files, since it would be too time consuming to
                           have Alchemy process every file in the current
                           directory.  As such, it is possible for you to
                           select a file which Alchemy itself will not
                           recognize when a conversion or view is requested.

            Select Output  Selecting the Output Type will display a scrolling
                     Type  window containing the different image formats to
                           which Alchemy can output.  The up and down arrow
                           keys will move the highlight bar up and down one
                           try, and the PgUp and PgDn keys will move the
                           highlight bar up and down one page.  Pressing
                           Return selects the highlighted output type.  The
                           mouse can also be used to scroll through the
                           window: clicking on the up and down arrows will
                           move the highlight bar up and down one entry, and
                           clicking in the scroll bar above or below the
                           current location marker will page up and down
                           through the list.



                           If you select an output format that has further
                           options (such as compression type), a further pop-
                           up menu will ask you to pick an option.  Either
                           typing the highlighted key or clicking on the name
                           will select that option.

              Image Stats  After selecting an input file, selecting this
                           option will display various information for that
                           file, including the height and width, number of
                           colours, and compression ratio.  Other values may
                           be displayed, if they are available, such as dots
                           per inch (DPI), aspect ratio, and gamma.





                                                    Image Alchemy          25




                  Viewing  The next four options are for viewing the image
                           you have selected.  View Image will do a standard
                           8-bit view on an SVGA monitor, displaying only the
                           center portion of the image if it exceeds maximum
                           screen resolution.  Using the View Scaled option
                           will work similarly, except it will use Nearest
                           Neighbor scaling to make sure the entire image
                           fits on the screen.



                           If you have an SVGA board and monitor capable of
                           displaying images in true colour (15-, 16-, or 24-
                           bits), select View True Color to take advantage of
                           this.  This option will try to view in the highest
                           resolution possible, while displaying as much of
                           the image as possible.  Note, however, that size
                           will take priority over resolution.  For example,
                           if you have a 24-bit SVGA card with 1MB of memory,
                           you should be able to view in 24 bits at 640x480,
                           and 15 bits at 800x600.  So, assuming you have a
                           640x480 24-bit image, this option will view it in
                           24 bits.  If, however, you have a 700x490 24-bit
                           image, you will see the whole image, but dithered
                           to 15 bits.  Size takes priority over resolution.

                           If you have an image larger than what your
                           card/monitor can display in true colour, using the
                           View True Color Scaled option will scale the image
                           so you can view the entire image in true colour.

             Show Command  Choosing this option will display the parameters
                     Line  which will actually be passed to Alchemy if the
                           Convert! entry is chosen.  This allows you to see
                           what parameters need to be passed to Alchemy on
                           the command line to enable various options.

             Basic/Expert  This menu entry will change, depending on the
                    Menus  current status of the menu system.  When first
                           started, the GUI will default to Basic mode, which
                           will hide many of the more obscure options Alchemy
                           deals with.  Choosing this option will then force
                           the GUI to use the full, more advanced menus which
                           include all possible options.



                           When the Expert menus are being used, choosing
                           this option will switch back to the Basic menu
                           system.

                 Convert!  This should be the last option you select when
                           converting an image; use it only after you have
                           selected all the options you need from the various
                           other menus.


                           After choosing this option, you will be prompted
                           for an output filename, with a default given based
                           on the output type chosen.  To accept, simply type
                           Return.  You may of course modify the default by
                           typing different names, drives, or directories.


                           The GUI will then run the Alchemy software,
                           passing along information about the various
                           options you have selected in the menu.  Since the
                           GUI swaps almost all of itself out of memory
                           before calling Alchemy, you do not need to worry
                           about not having enough memory available for a
                           particular conversion; if the GUI runs out of
                           memory, calling Alchemy directly from the command
                           line will also run out of memory.  If this is the
                           case, contact us about Alchemy/386, which runs in
                           32-bit protected mode, and hence does not have the
                           typical memory limitations associated with DOS
                           applications.

                     Quit  This option will end your GUI session, and return
                           you to the DOS prompt.

          The Resize       The options in this sub-menu allow you to control
          Sub-Menu         various aspects of the output image concerning its
                           pixel size and DPI information.  Along with being
                           able to specify a certain pixel size, you can also
                           tell Alchemy to make an image larger or smaller by
                           some factor.  Finally, you can specify the aspect
                           ratio and DPI information from within this menu.

                           For further information about the specific options
                           in this sub-menu, please see Chapter 6.

          The Palette      The entries in the palette sub-menu allow you to
          Sub-Menu         control various aspects of the palette and its
                           generation, including using Heckbert's algorithm,
                           a uniform palette, or a black and white/greyscale
                           palette.  You can also tell Alchemy to use a
                           palette from another image, or correct colours in
                           a CMYK format using an undercolor removal file.

                           one of three different algorithms.  Finally, from
                           within this sub-menu, you can modify the input,

          Output Options
          -------------------------------------------------------------------


          Introduction     The one option which is always required when
                           running Image Alchemy is the output image file
                           type.  Even if you are just re-sizing an image, or
                           changing the number of colours in an image,
                           Alchemy needs to know what type of image you are
                           creating.


                           The file types that Image Alchemy supports are
                           listed below.  In addition to the syntax required
                           to generate the file, any known restrictions or
                           limitations are listed.  If you have trouble
                           reading an image in one of the file formats we
                           claim to support please contact us (see Appendix
                           D, Customer Support).



                           The common output options consist of a single
                           letter.  The option, like all Alchemy options, is
                           preceded by a dash, "-".  The less common output
                           options consist of a letter preceded by two
                           dashes, "--".

            With your GUI  If you are using the GUI, you can select your
                           output option from the File sub-menu as described
                           in Chapter 3.


               Variations  Some of the output formats have several
                           variations; in those cases you specify which
                           variation you want with an optional letter and/or
                           number after the output option.

                  Example  The option to generate a Windows Bitmap file is -
                           w.  There are two types of Bitmap files:
                           uncompressed and Run-Length-Encoded (RLE).  To
                           write out an uncompressed Bitmap file use -w0; to
                           write out a RLE Bitmap file use -w1 (the default
                           Bitmap file is uncompressed, so a -w without any
                           parameter following it would also generate an
                           uncompressed Bitmap file).  Note that Alchemy
                           allows spaces between the option and parameter, so
                           typing -w 1 would be the same as -w1.


               Variations  Be aware that the other options specified on the
                           command line also affect the type of file that is
                           generated.

                  Example  Within the Windows Bitmap file type there are 1
                           bit, 4 bit, 8 bit, and 24 bit files.


                           Alchemy always generates a file using the best
                           match of the file type and the output image.  So,
                           in the case of Windows Bitmap files, if the output
                           image is black and white a 1 bit file is
                           generated.  If the output image is paletted with
                           16 colours or less a 4 bit file is generated.  If
                           the output image is paletted with more than 16
                           colours an 8 bit file is generated.  And if the
                           output image is true colour a 24 bit file is
                           generated.


                           You can explicitly force any of these file types
                           by using other Alchemy options.  For example, if
                           you wanted a 1 bit Windows Bitmap file you would
                           specify -c2 -b -w.  To force a 4 bit file use
                           -c16 -w.  To force an 8 bit file use -c256 -w.
                           And to force a true colour file use -24 -w.


          Identifying      Image Alchemy identifies the type of file being
          image files      read by checking various magic numbers and other
                           information that varies from format to format.
                           Unfortunately, some formats do not have a magic
                           number; in those cases Alchemy guesses as to the
                           image type.  It is possible for Image Alchemy to
                           incorrectly identify an image; if this happens
                           please contact us.

          MacBinary        When reading images, Alchemy automatically
                           recognizes and reads MacBinary II files (MacBinary
                           files are generated when you accidently leave
                           MacBinary mode on when transferring a file from a
                           Macintosh).

          Other            Alchemy will preserve as much information in each
          information      file as possible; this always includes the height
                           and width of the image and the number of colours
                           in the image.  Some file types include other data,
                           such as the name of the image, the aspect ratio of
                           the image, the date the image was created, etc.
                           Since most of these items are only supported by a
                           few file formats, Alchemy discards everything but
                           the height, width, number of colours, gamma,
                           aspect ratio, and resolution values.

                           Alchemy discards all but the top 8 bits when
                           reading 11 bit AVHRR files.  When writing, the
                           bottom 3 bits are padded with 0.

                           Since AVHRR images are always grayscale, Alchemy

                           writing a AVHRR file.

          Comments         AVHRR images contain a lot of information which is
                           not part of the image data.  This information
                           includes the time and date the image was captured,
                           the satellite which captured the image, the type
                           of instrumentation used, etc.  When reading AVHRR
                           images this information is discarded; when writing
                           AVHRR images 0 is written for all values for which
                           data is unavailable.

                           There are quite a few programs which produce image
                           files which contain just pixel data.  These image
                           files do not have a header and hence do not
                           include enough information to allow Alchemy to
                           read them.

                           BIF files are a method which can be used to allow
                           Alchemy to read these images.  BIF files can also
                           be created to allow images to be read by software
                           which expects images to be just pixels.  Since
                           required information, such as the height and width
                           of the image, are not present in these files you

          Limitations      Paletted files cannot be read in (a work around is
                           to generate a .PAL file and then false colour the
                           gray-scale image using the -F option).

          Comments         BIF files are used to read and write files which
                           consist entirely of image data.  You have to
                           generate a text file which describes the format of
                           the data you are trying to read in.  This file is
                           called a BIF file.  The format of BIF files is
                           documented in Appendix E, Binary Information
                           Files.  You then instruct Alchemy to read the
                           image data by giving it the name of the .BIF file.

                           ID, are ignored.

          Comments         Since CALS files are always black and white,
                           Alchemy assumes the use of the -b, -8, and -c2
                           options when writing CALS files.


                           CALS images are Fax Group IV compressed and are
                           therefore a good way of storing black and white

          Comments         This format is not the same as IBM Picture Maker.

                           The option for adjusting the image size to 512 x
                           488 was added because Cubicomp PictureMaker does
                           not work with images which are not of this exact
                           size.  If either the X or Y dimension is larger
                           than 512 or 488, respectively, that dimension will
                           be truncated.  If either dimension is smaller than
                           512 or 488, the image will be padded on the right-
                           hand side or bottom, as necessary, with black.


                           PictureMaker images have either three or four
                           separate files per image: a red, green, blue, and
                           optional alpha channel.  You specify the name of
                           the .r8 file and Alchemy automatically generates

                           comments section below for more information).

          Comments         ER Mapper files are actually two files, one with

                           extension.  The .ers file contains header
                           information and the non-extensioned file contains
                           the actual image data.  You specify the name of
                           the .ers file and Alchemy automatically generates
                           the name of the other file.

                           Using the -Z option it is possible to select a

                           channel is to be read as a grey-scale image or
                           three numbers to indicate which channels are to be

                           grayscale Sun Raster file.

          Limitations      When writing Erdas files Alchemy does not change
                           the extension depending on the number of bands in
                           the image; according to the specification gray-
                           scale files should have the extension .gis and
                           true colour files should have the extension .lan.
                           Alchemy always uses .lan.

          Comments         1 band files are read in as gray-scale images.

                           3 band files are read in as true colour images.

          Comments         Freedom of Press images are actually two files, a
                           data file and an info file.  You specify the name
                           of the data file and Alchemy automatically
                           generates the name of the info file.  The output
                           file is normally output.001, output.002, etc.
                           Alchemy will strip the first part of the name and
                           replace it with 'info', so if you specified an
                           output filename of output.005 there will be
                           another file created called info.005.  If you
                           don't specify an extension, Alchemy will use .fop,
                           so you'll get two files named filename.fop and
                           info.fop.  Alchemy will overwrite info files
                           without warning.

                           scaling the image to 2500 pixels across (and
                           scaling proportionately vertically) using nearest

                           colour files.

          Limitations      The support for colour and multiple bit grayscale
                           GEM files is not very universal.  Therefore make
                           sure the application you are using to read the GEM
                           files can in fact handle them.


                           Alchemy defaults to writing out a 1 bit, black and
                           white GEM file.  You can explicitly force a 3
                           plane colour file by use of the -c8 option and a 4
                           plane colour file by use of the -c16 option (you
                           may add a -b to write a grayscale file instead of
                           a colour file).

          Comments         Because colour GEM files have only 3 or 4 bits of
                           information and no palette support the quality is
                           generally not very good for scanned images.  The
                           GEM format seems to have been designed for line
                           drawings.



          Examples         Convert the image scan.pcx to a black and white

                           GIF files were originally developed by CompuServe
                           as a machine independent image file format.  GIF
                           files are clearly the most popular way of storing
                           8 bit, scanned or digitized images.  In addition
                           the compression ratio achieved by GIF files is
                           usually better than any other 8 bit format in
                           common use.  GIF89A files were introduced in 1990
                           as a method for including text and simple
                           animations.

                           Writes 1 through 8 bit GIF87A and GIF89A non-
                           interleaved files.

          Limitations      When reading GIF89A files only the first image in
                           the file is read.  Any text, overlays, pauses,
                           palette changes, etc. are ignored.


                           Because GIF files only store the size of the
                           palette to the nearest power of 2 the exact
                           palette size is lost when converting to and from
                           GIF files.  For example, if you convert a 240
                           colour Sun Raster file to a GIF file and back to a
                           Sun Raster file the resulting Sun Raster file will
                           have 256 colours.

          Comments         When writing a file you probably want to use the
                           GIF87A variation, since the GIF89A extensions
                           aren't necessary to store single images and a lot
                           of other software still can't read GIF89A images.
                           The only advantage to GIF89A is that the aspect
                           ratio of the image is preserved (GIF87A does not
                           have a provision for storing aspect ratio).


                           The GIF format includes a field for storing the
                           colour to be used for the background when viewing
                           files.  Alchemy does not make use of this value.
                           Alchemy sets the background colour to the darkest
                           colour in the palette when viewing files and
                           organizes the palette such that the first colour
                           is the darkest colour when writing GIF files, if
                           the palette is created by Alchemy (you can
                           override this by using the -z option).

                           Writes 8 bits per pixel images.

          Limitations      When reading 16 and 32 bit images Alchemy discards
                           all but the top 8 bits of data.


                           Alchemy discards any calibration data and level
                           maps when reading images.


                           Because of difficulty in getting a sufficient
                           number of test images in the GOES format
                           (especially the PUT format) reading GOES images
                           has not been thoroughly tested.  If you have any
                           GOES images  which Alchemy does not read correctly
                           please contact us.

          Comments         The GARS format is a 7680 bytes per block,
                           Motorola byte-order, EBCDIC format; the MCIDAS
                           format is a continuous data, Intel byte-order,
                           ASCII format.


                           Since GOES images are always grayscale, Alchemy
                           assumes the use of the -b and -8 options when
                           writing a GOES file.

                           GOES images contain a lot of information which is
                           not part of the image data.  This information
                           includes the time and date the image was captured,
                           the satellite which captured the image, the type
                           of instrumentation used, etc.  When reading a GOES
                           image this information is discarded; when writing
                           a GOES image 0 is written for all values for which
                           data is unavailable.

          Limitations      In addition to raster images, PCL files can
                           include text and vector graphics information.
                           When reading Alchemy only pays attention to raster
                           images in the file and attempts to skip everything
                           else.  See Appendix A, Answers to Frequently Asked
                           Questions, for further discussion of this.


                           The only resolutions allowed in PCL files are
                           75 DPI, 100 DPI, 150 DPI, and 300 DPI (and, in the
                           case of LaserJet 4 type files, 200 DPI, and
                           600 DPI )


                           The X and Y resolution must be the same.


                           If you specify a non-allowable resolution Alchemy
                           automatically alters the resolution to the next
                           higher resolution.  For example, if you specify
                           250 DPI Alchemy will write a 300 DPI PCL file


                           If no resolution is specified either on the
                           command line or in the input file Alchemy
                           automatically choses the smallest resolution which
                           will allow the entire image to fit on the page.

          Comments         Since PCL files are always 1 bit, black and white
                           files, Alchemy assumes the use of the -b, -c2, and
                           -8 options.


                           When converting colour or gray-scale images to PCL
                           you will probably want to scale the output so the
                           image will be larger than the input image.  This
                           will allow the dithering to preserve more detail
                           in the image.


                           PCL files can be used to generate output which can
                           be printed on HP LaserJet and compatible printers.
                           The easiest method is to simply generate a .PCL
                           file and then copy it to the printer by using the
                           copy command (when using the copy command from MS-
                           DOS you will have to use a /B to make sure the
                           entire file is copied to the printer; see the
                           example below for more information).

                           Not all PCL compatible printers can print all
                           types of compressed PCL file.  Specifically,
                           LaserJet II, IID, and earlier printers can print
                           only uncompressed PCL files.  LaserJet IIp
                           printers can print only uncompressed and RLE
                           compressed files.  LaserJet III, IIID, IIIp,
                           IIIsi, and 4 printers can print all types of
                           compressed PCL files.

                           In general, the higher the compression type, the
                           better the compression ratio.

                           The Landscape option can be used to write a
                           landscape PCL file.  Because of changes in the PCL
                           format, only LaserJet III and newer printers can
                           print Alchemy produced landscape PCL files.

                           It is now possible to write a PCL file directly to
                           a HP LaserJet or compatible printer.  If you use
                           the name of the device as the output file name
                           Alchemy will redirect output to that device (for
                           example, use prn: as the output file name if your
                           LaserJet is attached to the prn: port) .

                           Alchemy will generate a colour RTL file unless the
                           input file is black and white or grayscale or the
                           -b option is specified as part of the conversion.

                           RTL files can be used to produce output which can
                           be printed on HP colour printers and raster
                           plotters.  The file can be printed by sending the
                           file to the plotter.  There is no additional setup
                           required for the PaintJet.  HP7600 series plotters
                           should be in HP-GL/2 mode best results will
                           generally be achieved with compensation off.  To
                           get colour plots from the HP7600 series the
                           plotter must be in 4 or 5 pass mode.  The file
                           must be sent to the printer/plotter in binary mode
                           (for MS-DOS systems, use the /B option with the
                           copy command).

                           If the input is black and white, you probably want
                           to do the conversion without an undercolour
                           removal file and with dithering off.  See below
                           for an example.


                           If the input is gray-scale, you probably do want
                           to use an undercolour removal file to perform
                           density correction, but with 100% black removal
                           (the black removal tables should contain 0 through
                           255, increasing by one each line) so that the
                           output won't contain cyan, magenta, or yellow.
                           The sample directory on the distribution diskette
                           has a UCR file called gray.ucr which has 100%
                           black removal.

                           The HSI JPEG format is a variation of the JPEG
                           format that was designed by Handmade Software to
                           better compress paletted images.  Paletted images
                           often have large areas where the image consists of
                           1 or 2 colours; JPEG compression does a poor job
                           on these sections when compared to LZW
                           compression.  HSI JPEG files are a combination of
                           JPEG and LZW compression.

          Comments         If you're writing an ILBM file for use on an
                           Amiga, you probably want to write either a
                           paletted file with 32 colours or a 24 bit file.
                           24 bit ILBM files can then be converted to one of

                           JPEG is a new type of image file format that uses
                           a lossy compression technique to achieve high
                           compression ratios.  See Appendix C, JPEG
                           Compression, for more information.

          Used by          Lossy compression of photographic images.

          Variations       Gray-scale images are saved as single channel JPEG
                           files; colour images are saved as three channel
                           JPEG files.

                           Reads and writes baseline JPEG with CCIR-601 YCbCr
                           colour space, interleaved components, Huffman or
                           arithmetic coded.

                           Alchemy can read files with any component sub-
                           sampling up to 4x4; it always writes 2h:1v 1h:1v
                           1h:1v.

                           Alchemy Huffman coded JPEG files comply with the
                           industry standard `JFIF' interchange format.

          Limitations      JPEG files are always lossy, which means that the
                           compressed image is not identical to the original
                           image.  At high quality factors (32 and above)
                           this loss is generally so slight as to be barely
                           noticeable.  There is no quality factor which is
                           guaranteed to be lossless.

          Comments         By default, Image Alchemy uses a fixed set of
                           Huffman tables to compress an image.  If the -j is
                           immediately followed by an 'h', Alchemy will
                           generate a set of custom tables optimized for the
                           image and quality factor.  This usually produces
                           5-20% better compression (depending on the image
                           content and quality factor) but requires an
                           additional pass over the image data, so it takes a
                           little longer to compress (there's no effect on
                           the decompression time).  Alchemy can also use
                           arithmetic coding (by specifying an 'a' after the
                           -j); this will produce 10-20% better compression;
                           this is at the expense of JFIF compatibility and
                           it takes a little longer to both compress and
                           decompress than Huffman coded files.

                           Quality may vary between 1 and 100; the default is
                           32.  The higher the number the higher the quality
                           of the image and the lower the compression ratio.
                           Quality factors below 10 will produce images with
                           significant loss of quality.

                           JPEG files are based on the Joint Photographic
                           Experts Group (JPEG) CD 10918-1 draft standard.

                           Since JPEG compression was designed for use with
                           continuous tone images (such as those produced by
                           a scanner or digitizer), poor results can be
                           expected when compressing line drawings.

                           image.

                           Because JPEG compression works on 8x8 pixel blocks
                           there may be discontinuities at the edges of these
                           blocks producing block artifacts.  Smoothing
                           attempts to reduce these artifacts.  Smoothing is
                           really only necessary at very low quality settings
                           (less than 10); even then the effects of smoothing
                           are not particularly significant.

          Examples         Convert the file photo.tga to a JPEG file called
                           photo.jpg, using a high quality setting:

                           The Pictor format was designed so that an image
                           could be loaded into an IBM graphics adapter very
                           quickly; it does this by almost exactly
                           duplicating the organization of the graphics
                           adapter memory.  This makes the format hardware
                           dependent.

          Variations       There are variations for most IBM and third party
                           graphics adapter display modes.

          Limitations      Only the EGA and VGA modes are supported at this
                           time.  Text modes are not supported.

          Comments         Some Pictor files do not contain palettes.  For
                           those files Alchemy will default to using a
                           standard palette appropriate to the display mode
                           the file was saved in.  However, the image may not
                           use the default palette; in that case you can read
                           the palette from another file with the -F false
                           colour option.

                           PCX files are used extensively by MS-DOS machines.
                           Originally created by ZSoft for use by their paint
                           packages, PCX files can be read and written by
                           almost all MS-DOS paint software and desktop
                           publishing software.

                           A new variation of PCX file, DCX, is used by many
                           MS-DOS fax boards.

                           PCX files suffer from two problems:  the
                           compression ratio is poor for 8 and 24 bit images
                           and PCX files are often written out incorrectly;
                           see the Limitations section below for details.

                           Most paint and desktop publishing software can
                           read and write PCX files.
                           Fax board software uses the DCX variation of PCX.

          Variations       1, 4, 8, and 24 bits per pixel for standard PCX
                           files.

                           8 bits per pixel for PCJ files.

          Limitations      PCX format files are often written out
                           incorrectly; Alchemy attempts to figure out what
                           is wrong and make intelligent decisions (things
                           Alchemy can deal with include PCX files without
                           palettes, files missing the last line of image
                           data, and files with illegal (and incorrect)
                           combinations of bits per pixel and planes).

                           24 bit PCX files are very new and most other
                           software cannot read them.  Therefore, unless you
                           are sure that the software you are using can read
                           a 24 bit PCX file, you probably want to use the -8
                           option to force Alchemy to write a paletted file
                           when generating a PCX file.


                           DCX files are multiple page PCX images which are
                           used by various manufacturers of fax boards and
                           fax software.  Alchemy only reads the first page
                           of a DCX file.  Alchemy always writes single page
                           DCX files which are black and white.

          Comments         Because so many software packages can read and
                           write PCX files we are especially interested in
                           supporting as many variations as possible.  If you
                           have any PCX files which Alchemy does not read
                           correctly please contact us.


                           Since DCX files are always 1 bit, black and white
                           images, Alchemy assumes the use of -b -c2 -8 when
                           writing the DCX variation of PCX.


                           ZSoft recently changed some of the information in
                           the header of PCX files so they now include image
                           resolution.  Some fax board software makes use of
                           this information when transmitting PCX or DCX
                           files as faxes.  See the example section below for
                           an example of how to specify image resolution when
                           writing a PCX file.

                           PCJ files are a variation of 256 colour PCX files
                           which have the palette in a separate file.  The
                           palette file has the extension .p13.  Alchemy will
                           automatically look for the palette file in the
                           same directory as the PCJ file when reading.

                           Writes 8 bit gray-scale uncompressed PDS files.

          Limitations      PDS images must begin with either an "SFDU_LABEL"
                           or a "FILE_TYPE" record for Alchemy to be able to
                           identify it.


                           Occasionally a PDS labeled image has a palette.
                           There doesn't seem to be any standard format for
                           the palette; Image Alchemy handles the palettes
                           we've encountered.


                           Any portions of the PDS labels not required to
                           extract the image, such as longitude and latitude,
                           are ignored.

          Comments         Since Image Alchemy only writes gray-scale PDS
                           images, Alchemy assumes the use of the -b option
                           when writing PDS files.


                           Some PDS images actually consist of two files, a
                           label file and a data file.  To read that type
                           image you should use the name of the label file
                           and Alchemy will find the data file.

                           The Portable BitMap format was developed by Jef
                           Poskanzer to allow the transferring of black and
                           white image files between different workstations.
                           The PBM format has grown to include black and
                           white, gray-scale, and true colour images, a large
                           set of programs to convert various other image
                           formats to and from PBM, and a set of image
                           manipulation tools.  The PBM tools are available
                           free of charge (unfortunately, due to their memory
                           requirements, many are not useable on MS-DOS
                           machines).

          Limitations      When writing a PBM file Alchemy always uses the
                           .pnm extension (the extension should be changed
                           based on the type of file being written).

          Comments         Q0 files are actually two files, one with the
                           extension .rgb or .q0 and the other with the
                           extension .fal.  The .rgb or .q0 file contains the
                           actual image data and the .fal file contains the
                           header information (primarily the height and width
                           of the image).  You specify the name of the .rgb
                           or .q0 file and Alchemy automatically generates
                           the name of the .fal file.

                           When writing a Q0 file Alchemy will overwrite,
                           without warning, existing .fal files.

                           program for the Macintosh that converts between
                           various image file formats and allows viewing of
                           graphics files.

                           Since QDV files are always paletted, Alchemy
                           assumes the use of the -8 option when writing QDV

                           version Scodl files could not be scaled by the MVP
                           software; new version Scodl files can be scaled
                           but only work the newer version of the MVP and

                           Scalable Scodl images have the advantages that
                           they do not have to be scaled to a specific output
                           resolution and are therefore generally smaller
                           than pre-scaled Scodl images.  They will can also
                           be imaged on a film recorder with any output
                           resolution or previewed on a monitor.

                           The disadvantage of scalable Scodl images is that
                           you must be using at least Scodl MVP version 4.2
                           and the Scodl MVP software does not perform very
                           high-quality scaling.  In particular, the MVP
                           software only does pixel replication scaling when
                           increasing the size of an image (this corresponds
                           to type 'a' scaling in Alchemy) and pixel
                           averaging when reducing the size of an image
                           (corresponding to Alchemy 'b' scaling).

                           Note that Alchemy pays attention to the aspect
                           ratio or dots per inch information specified as
                           part to command line or present in the original
                           image when converting to a Scodl scalable image.
                           Therefore you should insure that this information
                           is correct when writing a Scodl scalable image.

                           When writing Pre 4.2 Scodl files the image should
                           be scaled up to either 2000x1366 or 4000x2732 to
                           fill the slide.

                           There are some limitations with the current
                           version of the MVP software driver supplied by
                           Agfa/Matrix:

                           24 bit Scodl files are not correctly interpreted
                           by the MVP driver version 4.1 and earlier.  8 bit
                           images are correctly interpreted.

                           When sending very large images to the background
                           MVP driver you must be using version 4.0 or later
                           and have lots of EMS memory (4 Megabytes is
                           recommended).  When using the foreground MVP
                           program turning on disk caching is necessary.


          Example          Convert the file picture.im32 to a Scodl file
                           using high quality scaling and preserving the

          Limitations      Only GIS (tape) format images are written.

          Comments         SPOT Image GIS (tape) images are actually three
                           files.  You specify the name of the .hdr file and
                           Alchemy automatically generates the name of the
                           .bil and .clr files.


                           If no palette file (.clr file) exists Alchemy will
                           assume the image is grayscale.


                           There may also be a statistics file with a .stx
                           extension, but Alchemy ignores this file.


                           When writing a SPOT file Alchemy will overwrite,
                           without warning, existing .bil and .clr files.


                           When reading a CCT (CD-ROM) format image specify
                           the complete path and name of the image file.  For
                           example:  alchemy l:\scene04\imag_04.dat -g will
                           convert the scene 4 image to a .gif file.

                           colours they are treated as true colour.

          Comments         Stork images are stored in two or three files
                           (depending on whether or not there's a colour
                           lookup table associated with the image).  The
                           filename given to Alchemy should be the name of
                           the data file (normally with a suffix of .pre);
                           Alchemy will generate the names of the other files
                           by stripping the extension and appending .idx for
                           the index file and .tab for the colour lookup
                           table (if any).  Alchemy will overwrite existing
                           .idx and .tab files without warning when creating
                           Stork files.

                           and 8 bit Byte Encoded (RLE) files.

          Limitations      For a short time a version of the PBM toolkit
                           wrote Sun Raster files which had the wrong RGB
                           order.  Unfortunately there seem to be many images
                           which were generated with this incorrect RGB
                           order.  Please be aware that Alchemy's Sun Raster
                           reading and writing capability has been
                           extensively tested and compared to various other
                           tools; the RGB order we use is correct.

          Comments         Sun Raster files are normally not compressed and
                           so take up lots of disk space.


                           There is no standard extension for Sun Raster
                           files; the extensions that Alchemy uses seem to be
                           the most common.

          Example          Convert the SGI file sgiout to a sun raster file
                           called sun.im8:

                                alchemy -s sgiout sun.im8

                           pixel please contact us.

                           When writing TIFF files using any of the fax
                           compression types (Group III, Group IV and CCITT
